<p>How I tested my mobile profile site:</p>
<p>
	I used Opera Mobile to simulate two Amazon Kindles, and two HTC phones. I made sure to have one 
long skinny tablet, one shorter fatter tablet, one large phone and one small phone. I also tried them
landscape, and used tap gestures to zoom in and out.
	I found the Opera Mobile app extremely useful, although there are still enough variables I don't
understand that I was not able to calculate font sizes without trial and error. Maybe next time I will
get on that level.
